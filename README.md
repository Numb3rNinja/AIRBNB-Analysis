# Project Background
With the rapid growth of the short-term rental industry, platforms like Airbnb have transformed the way people travel, offering unique experiences beyond traditional hotels. As the market becomes increasingly competitive, understanding the dynamics of pricing, host performance, and guest preferences has become essential for both property owners and travelers.
This project was inspired by the desire to explore the global landscape of Airbnb listings and uncover what drives affordability, popularity, and success on the platform. By analyzing real-world data from diverse countries and host profiles, the goal was to gain a clearer picture of how Airbnb functions across different regions and to identify trends that reflect the evolving demands of modern tourism.

Key Insights and Recommendations Focused on:
- **Country-Level Price Trends:** An evaluation of country-level pricing to understand which markets offer the most budget-friendly listings and where pricing opportunities exist for expansion or targeting.
- **Hosting Activity and Listing Volume:** Analysis of host listing distribution to identify the scale of host operations and assess the competitive landscape among hosts.
- **Price vs. Guest Capacity and Bedrooms:** Evaluation of how pricing scales with property size to help inform dynamic pricing strategies and optimal listing configurations.
- **Price vs. Ratings and Guest Satisfaction:** Analysis of the relationship between pricing and customer ratings to determine whether higher prices correlare with better guest experience.

# Project Background
With the rapid growth of the short-term rental industry, platforms like Airbnb have transformed the way people travel, offering unique experiences beyond traditional hotels. As the market becomes increasingly competitive, understanding the dynamics of pricing, host performance, and guest preferences has become essential for both property owners and travelers.
This project was inspired by the desire to explore the global landscape of Airbnb listings and uncover what drives affordability, popularity, and success on the platform. By analyzing real-world data from diverse countries and host profiles, the goal was to gain a clearer picture of how Airbnb functions across different regions and to identify trends that reflect the evolving demands of modern tourism.
